    <h1>Privacy Policy for [PhotoSketch]</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [August 31, 2025]</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to [PhotoSketch] ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Content:</strong> We collect the photos you upload to the App for the sole purpose of processing them through our AI image generation feature. These images are sent to our third-party service providers for processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized User ID:</strong> To manage your account, coin balance, and purchase history, we use Firebase Authentication to create a completely anonymous user ID. We do not collect your name, email address, or any other directly identifiable personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you make in-app purchases, we use a third-party service, RevenueCat, to process and manage these transactions. RevenueCat associates your purchase history with your anonymized User ID. We do not have access to your payment card information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we use information collected about you via the App to:</p>

        <li>Provide the core functionality of the App, which is to generate AI-powered images based on your uploaded photos and selected styles.</li>
        <li>Manage your in-app coin balance and restore purchases.</li>
        <li>Maintain your anonymous user session.</li>
        <li>Ensure the security and operation of our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information (Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your information. However, we may share information we have collected about you with third-party service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LightX API:</strong> Your uploaded photos are sent to the LightX API for processing to generate the final stylized image. We do not store your original or generated images on our servers after the process is complete. Please refer to the LightX privacy policy for more information on how they handle data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase for anonymous authentication and to store data related to your anonymous user account, such as your coin balance.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>
